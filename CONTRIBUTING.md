# How to contribute

If you think you can help me out and help to update this project, I am inviting you to do so.

## Submitting issues

If you see anything you think is broken or needs improvement, please create a GitHub issue for us to take a look at it.

## Writing patches for bugs or improvements

You are free to submit changes because of bugs or improvements you see necessary.

## Testing

Please make sure you have tested you code and also tried a clean install from the empty repo without installed packages and such to be sure.

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request to our master branch with a clear list of what you've done. Also include a GitHub issue number if applicable.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

### Thank you!
